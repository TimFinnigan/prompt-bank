# Privacy Policy for Prompt Bank Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** March 20, 2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Prompt Bank Chrome Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your information. We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our users' data.

## Information Collection and Use

### Local Storage

The Prompt Bank extension stores all user prompts locally on your device using Chrome's `storage.local` API. This means:

- Your prompts are stored only on your computer
- Your prompts are not transmitted to any external servers
- Your prompts are only accessible by you and the extension

### Data Not Collected

We do not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:

- Personal identification information
- Chat history or conversation content from ChatGPT
- Browsing history
- Any analytics or usage metrics

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions, and here's why:

1. **Storage Permission**: To save your prompts locally on your device.
2. **Tabs Permission**: To detect when you are using the ChatGPT website and enable the extension functionality.
3. **Scripting Permission**: To inject the necessary scripts that allow the extension to function on the ChatGPT website.
4. **Host Permissions** for chat.openai.com and chatgpt.com: To allow the extension to operate only on the ChatGPT website.

## Third-Party Services

The Prompt Bank extension does not use any third-party services, analytics providers, or external APIs. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- We have no access to your stored prompts
- The security of your data depends on the security of your Chrome browser and your device
- When you uninstall the extension, all stored prompts will be deleted automatically by Chrome

## Children's Privacy

The Prompt Bank extension is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
